These information are overlayed on the sides of the cubes and the main monument model is put on the top of it. If you get close enough to the cube, you can hear relevant music w.r.t the location and you can even change the lighting by rotating the cube on the z-axis until it’s upside down, waiting for a few seconds, and then turning it back up.
