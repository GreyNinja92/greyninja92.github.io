created for CS 428 : Virtual, Augmented,\n            Mixed Reality. It is an VR Application built using Unity and VRTK v4\n            framework. The Project Requirements were to build upon project 2 &\n            modify the 3d model of the new EECCS building on Campus. I’ve\n            created a Ramen Selling Kiosk, Library, Theatre, Football Turf & a\n            Games section in the application. The theme of this project is the\n            current ongoing FIFA world cup. The Model has many features\n            including animations, auto-generating models, audio sources, objects\n            that can be interacted with (for e.g. picking up a ramen container,\n            rotating the tap in the sink to allow flow of water, using a lever\n            to control a light source), lighting schemes, etc. These features\n            have been described in more detail below.

For e.g. on the\n            ground floor near the library, we can easily obtain fps greater than\n            60 whereas on the top of the building in the theatre, the frame rate\n            drops to 30 when the screen is active.\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <h2>Discussion</h2>\n          <br />\n          <p>\n            Designers, for decades, have relied on Computer Assisted Design\n            (CAD) tools for building wireframes of 3D buildings while working on\n            screens that can only display 2d images. With VR, the interior\n            designers, the clients and any stakeholder can walk through the\n            structure exploring every detail before it’s built. There are\n            already several companies for e.g IrisVR, InsiteVR who’ve taken this\n            to the next level by allowing the designers to design in Virtual\n            Reality and allowing them to see their work on an actual 3d canvas.\n            They also allow for simultaneous collaboration with engineers.\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <p>\n            Although Augmented Reality can reach much more people thanks to the\n            penetration of smartphones in our world, it lacks the immersive-ness\n            and interactivity that can be provided with Virtual Reality.\n            Allowing anyone on any side of the globe to explore the new CS\n            building as if they’re standing inside of it creates a new level of\n            immersion and allows for much better visualization of the actual\n            building than e.g. looking at pictures of the new campus. Of course,\n            VR is still easily distinguishable from actual reality. It lacks the\n            resolution and some VR headsets struggle in handling slightly\n            complicated models leading to lower frame rates. Even with its\n            shortcomings, VR offers a much better alternative to exploring a 3d\n            space than looking at 2d projections of it on a 2d screen.\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <p>\n            Before any CAD file of a building is converted to a VR Application,\n            a few things would need to be changed. Proper Floor Logic would need\n            to be set so that the user stays fixed to the ground. Any object in\n            the CAD file that will be interactable in the real building would\n            need to be coded into the VR Application. This will help simulate a\n            real-life environment. Fortunately, some companies that are already\n            in this space of designing and VR have provided tools to make this\n            super easy. Even if you lack access to these tools, converting a CAD\n            model to a functional VR Application is not that difficult with\n            available VR frameworks like VRTK provided you’re aware of its\n            limitations.\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <p>\n            With the proper VR equipment, anyone can be made familiar with the\n            dimensions & the architecture of an architectural project. For\n            people who don’t have experience in working with VR for e.g our\n            parents, they would need some help setting up the headset and\n            launching the application. They would need to be taught about the\n            concept of boundaries in VR to protect users from bumping into\n            objects in the real environment while they’re exploring the virtual\n            one. They would also need to familiarise themselves with\n            teleporting. Since you can’t walk around in the virtual environment\n            beyond the boundaries drawn when you set up the VR headset,\n            exploring 3d models of an under-construction building will only be\n            possible using teleporting. Teleporting would allow them to move\n            from one point to the other in a 3d model instantly. They will also\n            require some instruction on the different buttons on the controllers\n            and their purpose. Once set up, they’ll be able to view any CAD file\n            of a new building as if they’re standing inside it.\n          </p>\n        </Project>\n      </Container>\n      <Footer />\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n\nconst Container = styled.div`\n  margin: 10rem;\n  @media (max-width: 1024px) {\n    margin: 8rem;\n  }\n  @media (max-width: 480px) {\n    margin: 8rem 1rem 3rem;\n  }\n`;\n\nconst Project = styled.div`\n  h2 {\n    font-weight: 600;\n    font-size: 2rem;\n  }\n\n  h3 {\n    font-weight: 400;\n    font-size: 1.5rem;\n  }\n\n  p {\n    font-weight: 400;\n    font-size: 1rem;\n    line-height: 1.6;\n  }\n\n  img {\n    width: 20rem;\n    padding: 1rem;\n    display: block;\n  }\n\n  ol {\n    list-style-type: numbers;\n    li {\n      padding: 10px;\n      margin-left: 35px;\n      line-height: 130%;\n    }\n\n    li > b {\n      font-weight: 600;\n    }\n  }\n\n  ul {\n    list-style-type: circle;\n    li {\n      padding: 10px;\n      margin-left: 35px;\n      line-height: 130%;\n    }\n\n    li > b {\n      font-weight: 600;\n    }\n  }\n`;\n\nexport default Project3;\n"],"names":["Wrapper","FooterGroup","FooterGrid","href","Twitter","Github","styled","Container","Project","title","id","src","style","width"],"sourceRoot":""}
