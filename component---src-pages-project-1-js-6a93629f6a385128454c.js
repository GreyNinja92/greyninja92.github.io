This can be achieved by the same technology. All we need is a cloth that acts as a physical object and the suit can be virtually placed on top of it.

Since it’s augmenting an actual physical object in your hand, this method still retains the physical feel of an actual racket which most players consider to be essential to play effectively and enjoy the game.

While AR glasses exist today, they’re either too expensive, not marketed towards consumers but primarily business customers or too bulky for everyday use. If we want AR glasses to penetrate the consumer market, we’d have to figure out how to manufacture them more economically, create a reliable and easy-to-code-to SDK for developers to build awesome AR apps & use power efficient system on a chip design based on the ARM architecture with built-in neural engine for faster computation while having amazing performance-per-watt."))),o.a.createElement(c.a,null))}}}]);
