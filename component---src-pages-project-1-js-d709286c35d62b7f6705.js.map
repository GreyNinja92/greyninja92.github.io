It is an AR application built using Unity and the\n            Vuphoria Engine. It allows users to see two monuments : Eiffel Tower\n            & Statue of Liberty on top of paper cubes. It basically augments\n            physical objects by turning them into live interactive\n            computer-generated objects which show monuments, show the time & the\n            weather at the place of the monument as well as an interesting fact\n            about the monument. These information are overlayed on the sides of\n            the cubes and the main monument model is put on the top of it. If\n            you get close enough to the cube, you can hear relevant music w.r.t\n            the location and you can even change the lighting by rotating the\n            cube on the z-axis until it’s upside down, waiting for a few\n            seconds, and then turning it back up.

Today, we have several AR headsets, glasses & even\n            smartphones with SDKs supporting AR functionality. The pro model of\n            the iPhone ships with a LiDAR scanner for quick, easy & precise AR\n            overlays onto the camera output. AR applications which augment the\n            physical object by overlaying a virtual one on top of it are bound\n            to get more in-demand as cameras on our devices get better, custom\n            neural processing units ease the task of running CNNs and hardware\n            sensors like LiDAR become more popular.\n          </p>\n\n          <br />\n          <p>\n            AR already has various useful applications in real life today e.g.\n            measuring any surface with a virtually overlayed ruler, getting\n            directions when you’re going somewhere, AR games, etc. Some of the\n            more interesting games I’ve tried were the Angry Birds games in AR.\n            The structure falls to the surface visible on the camera as the\n            birds hit it. It also allows you to roam freely inside such an\n            environment, aiming wherever you please, and figure out the most\n            vulnerable point for any structure by seeing it from every angle.{\" \"}\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <p>\n            However, this project was based on enhancing physical objects to\n            create interactive computer-generated objects. The example shown in\n            this project is very basic compared to the applications that can be\n            created using this piece of technology. This project only focuses on\n            Monuments being overlayed on top of cubes with lighting & sound\n            effects. Just imagine being able to see how you look in a suit\n            before you buy it online. This can be achieved by the same\n            technology. All we need is a cloth that acts as a physical object\n            and the suit can be virtually placed on top of it. This will allow\n            customers to try on clothes before they buy them online. Imagine\n            being able to play sports like table tennis in AR.{\" \"}\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <p>\n            We just need a handle which we can manoeuvre with our hand and a\n            pair of AR glasses. AR Glasses can overlay an actual table tennis\n            racket onto our handle and create a virtual table for people to play\n            on. This way, you can enjoy table tennis sessions wherever, and\n            whenever you want as long as you have the space. Since it’s\n            augmenting an actual physical object in your hand, this method still\n            retains the physical feel of an actual racket which most players\n            consider to be essential to play effectively and enjoy the game.\n            There are already toys available where the actual physical object\n            becomes interactive when viewed through the AR app made by the\n            manufacturer. I’m sure more toy manufacturers will get on board as\n            time goes on. This can help create more immersive experiences for\n            any physical product.\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <p>\n            The best way to view these types of AR objects would be a pair of AR\n            glasses. While our smartphones have tech inside of them which\n            enables them to provide immersive AR experiences, we still have to\n            hold & move our phones around to navigate in the AR environment. AR\n            glasses would eliminate this need as they would go right over your\n            head. While AR glasses exist today, they’re either too expensive,\n            not marketed towards consumers but primarily business customers or\n            too bulky for everyday use. If we want AR glasses to penetrate the\n            consumer market, we’d have to figure out how to manufacture them\n            more economically, create a reliable and easy-to-code-to SDK for\n            developers to build awesome AR apps & use power efficient system on\n            a chip design based on the ARM architecture with built-in neural\n            engine for faster computation while having amazing\n            performance-per-watt.\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <h2>Running the Project</h2>\n          <br />\n          <p>\n            This project is built on Unity and the Vuphoria Engine.
