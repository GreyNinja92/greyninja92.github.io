The example shown in this project is very basic compared to the applications that can be created using this piece of technology. This project only focuses on Monuments being overlayed on top of cubes with lighting & sound effects. Just imagine being able to see how you look in a suit before you buy it online. This can be achieved by the same technology. All we need is a cloth that acts as a physical object and the suit can be virtually placed on top of it.

Since it’s augmenting an actual physical object in your hand, this method still retains the physical feel of an actual racket which most players consider to be essential to play effectively and enjoy the game.

While our smartphones have tech inside of them which enables them to provide immersive AR experiences, we still have to hold & move our phones around to navigate in the AR environment. AR glasses would eliminate this need as they would go right over your head. While AR glasses exist today, they’re either too expensive, not marketed towards consumers but primarily business customers or too bulky for everyday use. If we want AR glasses to penetrate the consumer market, we’d have to figure out how to manufacture them more economically, create a reliable and easy-to-code-to SDK for developers to build awesome AR apps & use power efficient system on a chip design based on the ARM architecture with built-in neural engine for faster computation while having amazing performance-per-watt."))),r.createElement(u.Z,null))}}}]);
