It is an VR Application built using Unity and VRTK v4\n            framework. The Project Requirements were to create a kiosk inside\n            the 3d model of the new EECS building on Campus. I’ve created a\n            Ramen Selling Kiosk model and put it on the ground floor of the\n            building. The Model has many features including animations,\n            auto-generating models, audio sources, objects that can be\n            interacted with (for e.g. picking up a ramen container, rotating the\n            tap in the sink to allow flow of water), lighting schemes, etc.\n            These features have been described in more detail below.

Sometimes, when we\n            go to the front of the ramen shop, the frame rate can shoot up to 35\n            frames per second.

In Augmented Reality,\n            we augment the user’s surroundings by adding 3d objects but in\n            Virtual Reality, we replace the user’s environment with a\n            computer-generated environment. To interact with any object in this\n            virtual environment, we need to use the headset’s hand controllers.\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <p>\n            Virtual Reality can be experienced using a VR Headset. It can also\n            be simulated on the 2d screen of a computer and the controllers can\n            be simulated using key presses on our computer’s keyboard. This\n            allows us to explore the scene while developing the application\n            right on our coding machines instead of plugging & unplugging the\n            headset into our computer. The simulator allows us to move around\n            the environment with WASD keys, use the number pad on our keyboards\n            to control the position of our simulated controllers and use the\n            left mouse button to simulate a button press on the controller.\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <p>\n            However, there are a few shortcomings of this approach. One, the\n            simulator can only simulate one button of the controller.\n            Controllers usually have plenty of buttons & some even have\n            joysticks to move around the interface, interact with objects, etc.\n            Virtual Reality frameworks usually allow us to customize which\n            button on our controller we’d like to use to interact with the\n            object. But, only one button can be simulated in a simulator.\n            Usually, if your application is simple and only allows for one\n            interaction per object, you won’t run into this issue. However, if\n            you’re building a game with complex interactions, each triggered by\n            a different button press, you won’t be able to use the simulator to\n            thoroughly test your application.\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <p>\n            To properly experience VR, you need a VR headset. When you put on\n            the headset, you’ll have to adjust the lenses by shifting them left\n            or right until the image on the lenses becomes clear. Using a VR\n            Headset, you can freely use the controllers to interact with objects\n            in the environment and test every interaction written into the\n            application. Most VR Headsets will ask to initialise a safe area\n            around your real space and it’ll only allow direct movement in the\n            app until you’re within the bounds of the safe area. This is\n            obviously to ensure you don’t bump into physical objects in your\n            real environment e.g. a table, chair, etc. Most VR Headsets also\n            allow us to disconnect our headsets from the computer once the\n            application has been installed so we can truly freely move around\n            the environment.\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <p>\n            VR Headsets have their own set of disadvantages. First, they aren’t\n            cheap. Second, the most obvious one is that the environment might\n            still look pixelated and not as sharp as in a simulator. This is\n            because the lenses on most headsets have a lower resolution than\n            most modern laptops. The difference is night and day between the\n            resolution of your eye and the lenses on the headset so this virtual\n            environment still is far off from being as immersive as reality.\n            Third, the processors these headsets use are usually much slower\n            than you can find in a modern computer. Your application will\n            usually run slower on a headset than a simulator because the\n            headset’s chip is constrained to a much smaller space than your\n            computer. You can usually check this by turning on the FPS counter\n            and then comparing the difference between your computer and the\n            headset.\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <p>\n            That being said, viewing on a headset is still a major step up from\n            viewing in a simulator. Most headsets have spatial sound support\n            which can simulate sounds coming from an actual 3d environment. VR\n            Headsets are also way more immersive as they completely cover your\n            eyes. While we’re still far off from creating a virtual reality that\n            is indistinguishable from the real world, the VR headset is\n            certainly our best attempt.\n          </p>\n        </Project>\n      </Container>\n      <Footer />\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n\nconst Container = styled.div`\n  margin: 10rem;\n  @media (max-width: 1024px) {\n    margin: 8rem;\n  }\n  @media (max-width: 480px) {\n    margin: 8rem 1rem 3rem;\n  }\n`;\n\nconst Project = styled.div`\n  h2 {\n    font-weight: 600;\n    font-size: 2rem;\n  }\n\n  h3 {\n    font-weight: 400;\n    font-size: 1.5rem;\n  }\n\n  p {\n    font-weight: 400;\n    font-size: 1rem;\n    line-height: 1.6;\n  }\n\n  img {\n    width: 20rem;\n    padding: 1rem;\n    display: block;\n  }\n\n  ol {\n    list-style-type: numbers;\n    li {\n      padding: 10px;\n      margin-left: 35px;\n      line-height: 130%;\n    }\n\n    li > b {\n      font-weight: 600;\n    }\n  }\n\n  ul {\n    list-style-type: circle;\n    li {\n      padding: 10px;\n      margin-left: 35px;\n      line-height: 130%;\n    }\n\n    li > b {\n      font-weight: 600;\n    }\n  }\n`;\n\nexport default Project1;\n"],"names":["Wrapper","FooterGroup","FooterGrid","href","Twitter","Github","styled","Container","Project","title","id","src","style","width"],"sourceRoot":""}
