The Model has many features including animations, auto-generating models, audio sources, objects that can be interacted with (for e.g. picking up a ramen container, rotating the tap in the sink to allow flow of water, using a lever to control a light source), lighting schemes, etc. These features have been described in more detail below.

Of course, VR is still easily distinguishable from actual reality. It lacks the resolution and some VR headsets struggle in handling slightly complicated models leading to lower frame rates.

Fortunately, some companies that are already in this space of designing and VR have provided tools to make this super easy.

They would need to be taught about the concept of boundaries in VR to protect users from bumping into objects in the real environment while they’re exploring the virtual one. They would also need to familiarise themselves with teleporting. Since you can’t walk around in the virtual environment beyond the boundaries drawn when you set up the VR headset, exploring 3d models of an under-construction building will only be possible using teleporting. Teleporting would allow them to move from one point to the other in a 3d model instantly. They will also require some instruction on the different buttons on the controllers and their purpose.
