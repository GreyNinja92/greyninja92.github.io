It can also be simulated on the 2d screen of a computer and the controllers can be simulated using key presses on our computer’s keyboard. This allows us to explore the scene while developing the application right on our coding machines instead of plugging & unplugging the headset into our computer.

One, the simulator can only simulate one button of the controller. Controllers usually have plenty of buttons & some even have joysticks to move around the interface, interact with objects, etc. Virtual Reality frameworks usually allow us to customize which button on our controller we’d like to use to interact with the object. But, only one button can be simulated in a simulator. Usually, if your application is simple and only allows for one interaction per object, you won’t run into this issue. However, if you’re building a game with complex interactions, each triggered by a different button press, you won’t be able to use the simulator to thoroughly test your application."),l.createElement("br",null),l.createElement("p",null,"To properly experience VR, you need a VR headset. When you put on the headset, you’ll have to adjust the lenses by shifting them left or right until the image on the lenses becomes clear. Using a VR Headset, you can freely use the controllers to interact with objects in the environment and test every interaction written into the application. Most VR Headsets will ask to initialise a safe area around your real space and it’ll only allow direct movement in the app until you’re within the bounds of the safe area. This is obviously to ensure you don’t bump into physical objects in your real environment e.g. a table, chair, etc. Most VR Headsets also allow us to disconnect our headsets from the computer once the application has been installed so we can truly freely move around the environment."),l.createElement("br",null),l.createElement("p",null,"VR Headsets have their own set of disadvantages. First, they aren’t cheap. Second, the most obvious one is that the environment might still look pixelated and not as sharp as in a simulator. This is because the lenses on most headsets have a lower resolution than most modern laptops. The difference is night and day between the resolution of your eye and the lenses on the headset so this virtual environment still is far off from being as immersive as reality. Third, the processors these headsets use are usually much slower than you can find in a modern computer. Your application will usually run slower on a headset than a simulator because the headset’s chip is constrained to a much smaller space than your computer. You can usually check this by turning on the FPS counter and then comparing the difference between your computer and the headset."),l.createElement("br",null),l.createElement("p",null,"That being said, viewing on a headset is still a major step up from viewing in a simulator. Most headsets have spatial sound support which can simulate sounds coming from an actual 3d environment. VR Headsets are also way more immersive as they completely cover your eyes.
