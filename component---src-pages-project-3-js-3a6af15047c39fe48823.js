Allowing anyone on any side of the globe to explore the new CS building as if they’re standing inside of it creates a new level of immersion and allows for much better visualization of the actual building than e.g. looking at pictures of the new campus. Of course, VR is still easily distinguishable from actual reality. It lacks the resolution and some VR headsets struggle in handling slightly complicated models leading to lower frame rates.

Proper Floor Logic would need to be set so that the user stays fixed to the ground.

For people who don’t have experience in working with VR for e.g our parents, they would need some help setting up the headset and launching the application. They would need to be taught about the concept of boundaries in VR to protect users from bumping into objects in the real environment while they’re exploring the virtual one. They would also need to familiarise themselves with teleporting. Since you can’t walk around in the virtual environment beyond the boundaries drawn when you set up the VR headset, exploring 3d models of an under-construction building will only be possible using teleporting. Teleporting would allow them to move from one point to the other in a 3d model instantly. They will also require some instruction on the different buttons on the controllers and their purpose.
